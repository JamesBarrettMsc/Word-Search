<h3> Back of the box blurb</h3>
This project its self, is  mostly just a vehicle do so I can 
get up to speed  with the GitHub plastform & to a lesser extent 
git.

<h3> Disclaimer</h3>
My spelling is just awful and I tend to rely on the uses of speech to text software,
So you will see lots of spelling & grammar mistakes all  throughout anything 
I have typed. Yes, I have dyslexia & I'm always try to improve on my literacy.
